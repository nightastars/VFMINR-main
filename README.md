Sparse-view CT Reconstruction via Implicit Neural Representation Learning Powered by Dual-Domain Vision Foundation Models.

Note that FDVFM and SDVFM require re-pretraining based on your datasets.

If you want to train the network, run train.py and modify the parameter configurations; if you want to perform inference, run test.py and modify the parameter configurations.

Please pay attention to the dataset format. For specific format requirements, refer to data.py.
